{"name":"Simplicity and synergy","tagline":"Haxe libraries for a better world!","body":"Hi, my name is Andreas, figuring on Github under the alias @ciscoheat. My language of choice is [Haxe](http://haxe.org), and with its power and elegance I'm trying to create useful libraries in the spirit of simplicity and synergy.\r\n\r\n## Haxe libraries\r\n\r\nAll of these are available on [haxelib](http://lib.haxe.org/) for a quick install. \r\n\r\nThe list is sorted in order of \"importance\", where importance is my estimation of how much the library will impact your thinking, programming style, and other long term benefits.\r\n\r\nName | Targets | Description\r\n:----|:-------:|:-----------\r\n[haxedci](https://github.com/ciscoheat/haxedci) | All | Taking programming into the next era with the [DCI architecture](http://fulloo.info/doku.php?id=faq). If you take your time to study and understand this paradigm created by the author of [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller), you will become a better programmer, guaranteed.\r\n[HaxeContracts](https://github.com/ciscoheat/haxecontracts) | All | Contracts is a way out of the wasteful unit testing that the current programming paradigm force most programmers into. Using Contracts you will move tests into program code, and greatly improve the integrity of your objects.\r\n[buddy](https://github.com/ciscoheat/buddy) | All | The interesting things in a system usually happens between objects, and this is where most code-based testing should be. Buddy is a [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) library for helping you move the testing mentality upwards, from method-level to interactions between objects.\r\n[dataclass](https://github.com/ciscoheat/dataclass) | All | Data is the very foundation of a system, representing what the system *is* (compared to functionality that represents what the system *does*). DataClass helps you define the foundation of your system, simple data objects, using a minimal Haxe syntax.\r\n[mithril-hx](https://github.com/ciscoheat/mithril-hx) | Browser, Node.js | [Mithril](mithril.js.org) is a small, yet great javascript MVC framework that is faster and more flexible than most others. Here are Haxe externs for this library, which lets you solve complex problems with simple tools.\r\n[slambda](https://github.com/ciscoheat/slambda) | All | Do you crave Short Lambdas? Understandable, every other language have them. Here's a tiny library that adds those convenient `x => x + 1` expressions to your Haxe code with a single `using` statement.\r\n[haxelow](https://github.com/ciscoheat/haxelow) | Browser, Node.js, Others | A small, flat JSON database library, if you need to store Haxe objects strongly-typed in JSON.\r\n\r\n## Haxe-related\r\n\r\nName | Targets | Description\r\n:----|:-------:|:-----------\r\n[empty-haxe-project](https://github.com/ciscoheat/empty-haxe-project) | Neko, Node.js, Browser | A convenient starting point for a new project, or if you just want to play around and get started quickly. Clone the branch of your choice from the repo, then follow the `README.md` instructions.\r\n[viagrant](https://github.com/ciscoheat/viagrant) | All and more | If you're using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), this will get a box with all your Haxe needs up and running in a few minutes. It also supports LAMP, a very convenient CMS, [concrete5](http://www.concrete5.org/), and some other goodies.\r\n\r\n## Synergy between the libraries\r\n\r\nHere's how I picture a system using the above libraries:\r\n\r\n### Setting up\r\n\r\n1. Clone [empty-haxe-project](https://github.com/ciscoheat/empty-haxe-project) to a directory and follow the `README.md` instructions to rename the project\r\n1. If you want, use [viagrant](https://github.com/ciscoheat/viagrant) to create the configuration for a Vagrant virtual machine in the same directory, starting it with `vagrant up`.\r\n\r\n### Designing the system\r\n\r\n1. Create the data objects with [dataclass](https://github.com/ciscoheat/dataclass) and validate their integrity with [HaxeContracts](https://github.com/ciscoheat/haxecontracts) when needed\r\n1. Use [buddy](https://github.com/ciscoheat/buddy) to draw up the guidelines for the system behavior using pending tests\r\n1. Let the data objects interact in Contexts with the help of [haxedci](https://github.com/ciscoheat/haxedci), fleshing out the pending buddy tests with testing of the Contexts. [HaxeContracts](https://github.com/ciscoheat/haxecontracts) will be of use too in the Contexts.\r\n\r\n### Programming style\r\n\r\n1. Use [slambda](https://github.com/ciscoheat/slambda) for functional programming and asynchronous calls with short and convenient lambda expressions.\r\n\r\n### Implementation details\r\n\r\n1. Let users interact with your system in an impressive browser app built with [mithril-hx](https://github.com/ciscoheat/mithril-hx)\r\n1. For data storage where speed isn't a big concern, use the convenient JSON storage of [haxelow](https://github.com/ciscoheat/haxelow).\r\n\r\n## Contact info\r\n\r\nIf you want to give feedback for a specific library, I appreciate if you open a Github issue for it. If you want to get in touch about anything else, my email is `ciscoheat AT gmail`, and I also twitter quite infrequently under the name [thedciguy](https://twitter.com/thedciguy). Hope to hear from you!\r\n\r\n/Andreas\r\n","google":"UA-20869379-2","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
